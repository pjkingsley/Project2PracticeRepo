            <li><a class="donate-list" href="https://www.communityactionskagit.org/skagit-food-distribution-center/">Skagit Food Distribution Center</a> <p  class="description hide">The Skagit Food Distribution Center, a partnership between Skagit County and Community Action, was established in 2006 as our country's first ever centralized Food Bank Distribution Center. The centralized warehouse allows the county’s food pantries and hot meal programs to effectively work as partners, streamlining services, saving time and money – and it promises to yield more food for our county’s hungriest families.</p></li>

            <li><a class="donate-list" href="https://www.marysplaceseattle.org/support-us/donation-drop-off ">Mary's Place Donation Center (sodo)</a><p  class="description hide">Since 1999, Mary’s Place has helped thousands of women and families move out of homelessness into more stable situations. Across five emergency family shelters in King County, we keep families together, inside, and safe when they have no place else to go, providing resources, housing and employment services, community, and hope.</p></li>
            <li><a class="donate-list" href="https://www.udistrictfoodbank.org/">University District Food Bank</a><p  class="description hide">The churches in the University District were overwhelmed by families asking for help with food.  There was a small program at Christ Episcopal Church which provided a few canned goods once per month, but the requests for this food were more than could be handled. At least one-third of the families asking for help were being turned away.  The closest food banks at the time were in Fremont and North Seattle, and were difficult to get to during their very limited hours of service.</p></li>
